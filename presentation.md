# Solidarity

We meet today on the unceded territory of the Ramaytush Ohlone. We affirm their sovereign rights as First Peoples. The process of colonization is ongoing in the Bay Area.

Cooperatives seek to build an alternative economic and social structure that bring communities together in solidarity.

You may individually express solidarity by paying the Yakult (Village) Land Tax: <https://www.ramaytush.org/donate.html>

# Ministry of Velocity

- Founded in 2013
- Software and training services
- Booked almost $13m in sales
- Mostly public sector / NPO
- Investigated co-op conversion in 2018
- Conversion in 2022/23

<!--
In 2013, I co-founded Ministry of Velocity with a friend, and we freelanced underneath that label as a partnership

My co-founder left in 2014, and I hired folks that I met through volunteering, client work, and in community

We mainly do custom software, design, and project management in the public and nonprofit sector, and we've booked about $13m in sales so far

In 2018, a couple dozen people worked at MoV, and I started investigating a co-op conversion with Project Equity

In 2022, we formally began the process of conversion, and by 2023 MoV was a cooperative

# Cooperative History

<!--
Cooperatives are a concept more than a specific legal vehicle: a bunch of people pool their resources together, participate in trade, and the members receive a benefit

At least as of a couple years ago, the earliest record of a cooperative is the Fenwick Weavers' Society 18th century Scotland

# Class War

![bg](assets/seven-dials-gustave-dore.jpg)

<!--
The cooperative mass movement, however, is born in class struggle during the era of Dickens' Oliver Twist.

In 1815, the British government's debt reaches a high of £1b at the end of the Napoleonic Wars.

The 1834 Poor Laws created workhouses where homeless Britons were housed, fed, and clothed. Labor was compulsory. Activists at the time called workhouses "Jails for the Poor"

One of the most popular theories among the rich was Malthusianism: a country’s population increases faster than its resources allow, which creates poverty

Malthus proposed a lower birth rate and a higher mortality rate by substituting philanthropy for the poor laws (welfare), which he felt “create the poor which they maintain”

# Owenism

<!--
Picture of New Lanark, Scotland

Robert Owen bought the cotton mill at New Lanark by his father-in-law David Dale in 1799. Owen didn't like the material conditions workers faced, and developed his own brand of utopianism socialism, and his ideas grew into public talks about self-governing “villages of co-operation”

In good conscience, I can't continue without acknowledging that Owen's wealth and utopian vision were built on the cotton industry

This means this early utopian vision is directly connected to industrialized chattel slavery in the United States, the damage of which is born to this day by Black and indigenous people in this country

# Rochdale

<!--
Owen's talks inspired The Rochdale Pioneers.

They started a successful series of businesses, starting with this store in Rochdale, which is still a location you can visit today, although the cooperative has moved to nearby Manchester.

The Pioneers were a mix of Chartist and Owenite activists, workers, and well-paid artisans.

Their model was wildly successful and hundreds of small cooperative stores popped up around northern England within a few years

# Co-optation

![bg](assets/sunkist-building.jpg)

<!--
This is a 1936 picture of the Sunkist building, headquarters of the California Fruit Growers Association, who established an alleged citrus monopoly in California

The USDA heavily promoted co-ops in the 1920s. With the passage of the Capper-Volstead Act, cooperatives became an easy way to avoid antitrust laws.

# Here and Now

<!--
Communities of color used co-ops to gain food access in the Jim Crow era and the natural foods movement adopted this strategy in the 1970s.

This picture, taken in 2016, shows some members of Cooperation Jackson, an example of a politically-active enterprise more in line with the original political and social movement of the Rochdale Pioneers

# Definition

![bg right:50%](assets/03-the-seven-cooperative-principles.png)

A cooperative is an autonomous __association__ of
persons united voluntarily to meet their common
economic, social and cultural needs and aspirations
through a jointly-owned and democratically-controlled
__enterprise__.

<!--
Historian, cooperative scholar, and Thompson Rivers University president Dr. Brett Fairbairn argues that cooperatives have a dual nature as an association and an enterprise.

While the enterprise aspect of cooperatives is similar to any business, the association aspect is a unique social formation that allows cooperatives to transcend profit-above-all logic and focus its energy on the community.

# The Enterprise

<!--
A co-op is a business, and it's important to explore what that means.

For the audience:
How many of you have started or run a business before?
-->

# Starting Up

<!--
If you're coming into this room and don't know what to build, I recommend the Lean Startup book by Eric Ries, even if you're going to be offering hourly consulting, in fact especially then

As your co-op starts up, it looks like everything else: recruiting founders, finding your first sale, doing a little planning, and finding money

If you find money, you'll incorporate, and you'll need to determine membership.

This is the first point of difference: your team is creating a power structure. Let's hear some wisdom from a co-op member at MoV

# Jeff Parr

> Co-ops require knowing business: accounting, reviewing contracts... all the business stuff.
>
> Missing that knowledge can make these topics uncomfortable. Your co-op lives or dies based on your how you respond as a group.
>
> Co-op developers, vendors, and technical assistance from peers can help build that knowledge.

<!--
This is Jeff Parr, who's been at Ministry of Velocity since 2015. Jeff's an entrepreneur with a few decades of experience as a founder

Jeff's insight is important: the discomfort he's speaking to here is a power dynamic on your team, it exists today and it's the first hump for your group

Here's a really important insight that speaks to Principle 5, education: you can pay to get skills or an expert in the room, and this can save your group.

# Distributing Income

<!--
Once you've decided who's a member, and how they enter the company, you'll need to have a conversation about how to distribute that income.

![bg fit](assets/patronage.svg)

<!--
Let's start from the top by imagining a worker-owned hardware store.

The hardware store makes $10,000 in a week, and the members collectively worked 100 hours.

The members also made a set of paid gardening videos, and that brings in $100 in a week.

The $100 from the videos may be retained by the cooperative, perhaps to reinvest it in the company.

# Workplace Democracy

<!--
For the audience:
When was the last time you made a decision that affected your workplace?
-->

There are two types of activity when operating a business

- _Governance_: setting policies to steer the ship
- _Management_: implementing policies and fulfilling administrative tasks

> You might ask how much time to expect to spend on co-op duties.
>
> There's no getting around it. If you aren't handling business today, taking on co-op tasks will be a transition.
>
> We managed our time with committees, where a smaller set of members handles one concern, then report to the board.

<!-- it's a reasonable question for prospective co-op members
to ask how much time they're expected to spend

especially if you're coming from design or engineering,
you'll spend more time on organizational matters

there will be an adjustment period

you'll participate in governance and management that will
impact your work

there's no getting around this, and the smaller the co-op
the more work there is to do

a committee is a group of members who specialize in one
area of management concerns, like finance or HR

I experienced this via sociocracy at MoV, this allows a
small set of people to implement policy

committee members have a duty to educate the larger body
so they can make informed governance decisions

members don't need to know everything or have a lot
of knowledge in order to make decision

committees at MoV were quite small, with an expert as
chair and a learner in an administrative role

this helps develop skills and capacity inside the co-op

a third party can fulfill that expert capacity -->
