# Cooperative History: Part 1

## Austerity Strikes Back

When the UK went bankrupt during the
Napoleonic Wars, the existing welfare
system fell prey to austerity.

<!--
One of the most popular theories among the rich was Malthusianism:
a country’s population increases faster than its resources allow,
which creates poverty

Malthus proposed a lower birth rate and a higher mortality rate by
substituting philanthropy for the poor laws (welfare), which he felt
“create the poor which they maintain”
-->

# Cooperative History: Part 2

## Utopianism

Robert Owen, a Welsh cotton industrialist,
proposed self-governing workhouses
(“villages of co-operation”) which provided
wages and a safety net.

---

# Cooperative History: Part 3

## Socialism

The Rochdale Pioneers, a mix of Chartist and
Owenite activists, workers, and relatively
well-paid artisans, start a successful series
of businesses.

---

# Cooperative History: Part 4

## The Modern Era

The USDA heavily promoted co-ops in the 1920s,
communities  of color used co-ops to gain food
access in the Jim Crow era, and the natural
foods movement adopted it in the 1970s.

Its members are the investors, and must both buy in and participate

# Experience Report: Jeff Parr

> You’ll be asking members who may not know about business
> for their input.
>
> This requires fluency in many disciplines: accounting, reviewing
> contracts, ... all the concerns that exist in business.
>
> Developers, vendors, and technical assistance from USWFC
> can help build that familiarity.
>
> Lacking business fluency can make these topics uncomfortable.
> The group's success lies in how it deals with that.

# Co-op Economics

- Business economics
  - Sell a commodity, such as a good or service
  - Pay laborers a wage less than the sale price
  - `c + NL + SL = W`
- Surplus reinvested in capital and management
- Traditionally, owners keep the remainder ("profit")
- In co-ops, the surplus is allocated to members as __Patronage__

# Workplace Democracy

<!--
For the audience:
When was the last time you made a decision that affected your workplace?
-->

- *Governance*: setting policies to steer the ship
