# Solidarity

We meet today on the unceded territory of the Ramaytush Ohlone.
We affirm their sovereign rights as First Peoples. The process of
colonization is ongoing in the Bay Area.

In solidarity, cooperatives seek to build an alternative economic
and social structure that opposes colonialism.

You may express individual solidarity by paying the Land Tax:

# Class War

![bg](assets/seven-dials-gustave-dore.jpg)

<!--
Like so much of history, cooperatives find their origin in class struggle,
starting in the era of Dickens.

In 1815, the British government's debt reaches a high of £1b
at the end of the Napoleonic Wars.

The 1834 Poor Laws created workhouses where homeless Britons
were housed, fed, and clothed. Labor was compulsory.

One of the most popular theories among the rich was Malthusianism:
a country’s population increases faster than its resources allow,
which creates poverty

Malthus proposed a lower birth rate and a higher mortality rate by
substituting philanthropy for the poor laws (welfare), which he felt
“create the poor which they maintain”

# Owenism

<!--
Picture of New Lanark

Robert Owen was made manager of New Lanark by his father-in-law

Owen didn't like the material conditions workers faced, and adopted utopianism

Owen's ideas grew into self-governing “villages of co-operation”

# Here and Now

<!--
The USDA heavily promoted co-ops in the 1920s,
communities  of color used co-ops to gain food
access in the Jim Crow era, and the natural
foods movement adopted it in the 1970s.

Today's cooperatives run the gamut between large enterprises like Mondragon,
small local businesses like a food co-op in your area, and social enterprises

Cooperation Jackson is an example of a politically-active enterprise

# Definition

![bg right:50%](assets/03-the-seven-cooperative-principles.png)

A cooperative is an _autonomous_ __association__ of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social and cultural needs and aspirations through a _jointly-owned_ and _democratically-controlled_ __enterprise__.

<!--
The dual nature of cooperatives is on display here:

A cooperative is an association of people, which is a social formation

It's also an enterprise, which is an economic formation

A cooperative is a business enterprise, first and foremost

Its members are the investors, and must both buy in and participate

> Co-ops require knowing business: accounting, reviewing contracts...
> all the concerns that exist.
>
> Missing that knowledge can make these topics uncomfortable. The
> co-op depends on its response.
>
> Co-op developers, vendors, and technical assistance from peers can help build that knowledge.

- Business economics
  - Sell a commodity, such as a good or service

- In co-ops, the surplus is allocated to members as __Patronage__
